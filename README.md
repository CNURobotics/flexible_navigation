Flexible Navigation
===================

NOTE: As of 9-March-2022 development of the ROS 2 version of Flexible Navigation
will be maintained at https://github.com/FlexBE/flexible_navigation.

It is suggested that you migrate to there for new ROS 1 work as well.

This site is being maintained for historical reasons, but future work should use
the https://github.com/FlexBE site, which will be the one-stop shop for all
things FlexBE going forward.

Flexible Navigation is a rework of the ROS Navigation stack into independent modules that
interface with [FlexBE] compatible state implementations.  These allow a user to graphically chain together states in a state machine to essentially create their own navigation stack to suit any need.

This allows for supervisory and sliding autonomy within navigation, and better control over contingencies and recovery behaviors.

About
-----

This system provides specific navigation planning and path following
capabilities based on the ROS Navigation [move_base] packages and is compatible
with any base_global_planner and base_local_planner plugin.

A ROS node wrapper for each plugin type provides several ActionLib
interfaces to [FlexBE] state implementations.

Install
-------

A complete demonstration system is provided as part of the CHRISLab [Turtlebot Flexible Navigation] demonstration. Follow setup and operation directions there for an integrated demonstration.  The complete system is easily setup and built by following the installation directions at [CHRISLab Install].

The [Turtlebot Flexible Navigation] demonstration uses the SBPL lattice planner in a move_base like planning scheme.  An alternative demonstration at [Create Flexible Navigation] uses a three layer planning scheme to demonstrate the flexibility of the decoupled approach.

The Flexible Navigation system has been tested using the latest version of ROS Kinetic. You
should first follow the [ROS Install Guide] and get that set up before proceeding.
