---------------------
0.3.0 Update for conversion to ROS2 Foxy
Currently, able to execute all flex_nav_controllers and flex_nav_planners nodes.
However, there are issues with Pure Pursuit due to TF2 issue #110.
https://github.com/ros2/geometry2/issues/110
This issue prevents the transforming of Point and PointStamped messages to different frames
such as the robot pose obtained from the odom frame not being transformed to the map frame.
Once, the issue is resolved and tf2_geometry_msgs Python version is released
then the Pure Pursuit nodes and states will be fully converted and executable.
