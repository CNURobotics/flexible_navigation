/**
 * @class FlexFollowPlanner
 * @brief A hybrid of base_local_planner and base_global_planner to make Paths
 *
 *   FlexFollowPlanner accepts Paths generated by another Flex Planner provided
 *   by way of a FollowPathAction. FlexFollowPlanner can be thought of as a
 *   mid-level planner as opposed to the traditional global and local planner.
 *   FlexFollowPlanner also has the ability to clear the local cost map by
 *   sending a ClearCostmapAction. Both abilities are handled by their own
 *   ActionServer interfaces and are accessible through the topic root and
 *   `clear_costmap` respectively.
