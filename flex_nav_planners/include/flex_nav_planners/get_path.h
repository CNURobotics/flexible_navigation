/**
 * @class GetPath
 * @brief An extension of base_global_planner that generates a top-level Path
 *
 *   GetPath accepts Poses indicating the desired goal point provided by way
 *   of a GetPathAction. GetPath also has the ability to clear the local
 *   cost map by sending a ClearCostmapAction. Both abilities are handled by
 *   their own ActionServer interfaces and are accessible through the topic
 *   root and `clear_costmap` respectively.
